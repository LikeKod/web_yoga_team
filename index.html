              The International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres is a non-profit
              organization named after Swami Sivananda, one of the most
              influential spiritual teachers of the 20th century and founded by
              his disciple Swami Vishnudevananda.

              The mission â€“ to spread peace, health and joy through yoga. All
              are welcome to come to our ashrams and centres to learn not only
              about how yoga can help maintain a healthy body but also how yogic
              philosophy, applied in daily life, can help maintain a peaceful
              mind and spirit.

              In 1957, Swami Vishnudevananda on instructions from his guru,
              Swami Sivananda, came to the West to bring the teachings of yoga.
              He established the first Sivananda Yoga Vedanta centre in
              Montreal, Canada, in 1959 and to date there are close to 60
              Sivananda locations (ashrams, yoga centres and affiliated centres)
              around the world. Over 26,000 teachers have been trained in the
              TTC programs.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Ashrams and Centres are recognized
              worldwide for teaching yoga authentically, preserving its purity
              and tradition dating back several thousand years. They also offer
              a wide range of programs and even the possibility for spiritual
              growth through Karma yoga as a temporary or full time staff
              program participant.

              As a marathon runner, I was looking to hire a yoga instructor to
              complement my running regime and to relieve running related aches
              and pains. Most of the trainers I found online were not up to the
              mark. Either they were not certified or they did not have the
              requisite experience to train clients with specific <br> needs such as
              me.
