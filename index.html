            In 1957, Swami Vishnudevananda on instructions from his guru, Swami
            Sivananda, came to the West to bring the teachings of yoga. He
            established the first Sivananda Yoga Vedanta centre in Montreal,
            Canada, in 1959 and to date there are close to 60 Sivananda
            locations (ashrams, yoga centres and affiliated centres) around the
            world. Over 26,000 teachers have been trained in the TTC programs.
